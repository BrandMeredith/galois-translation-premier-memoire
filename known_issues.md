Lemma 1 is missing from page 37

We have both my page numbering (1-17) and the original page numbering (35-49). Pick one.

Many of Galois's letters in his equations are non-italicized. Maybe work on that on a later draft if at all.

His phi and my phi differ.

Page 3 is repeated weirdly

The end of page 47 is confusing.
