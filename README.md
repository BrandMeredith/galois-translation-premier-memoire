# Premier Memoire by Everiste Galois
This repo holds a free translation of Everiste Galois' famous "Premier Memoire" where he describes Abstract Algebra for the first time. 

It is also called the "Memoir on the Conditions of Solvability of Equations by Radicals."

I felt that it's important to have this seminal work as a stand-alone free translation into English. None existed, so I am working on it, myself.

This is a work in progress. Please suggest changes or provide a pull request if you see any improvements that can be made.

This is written in LaTeX and developed using the online LaTeX editor Overleaf. The one .tex file in the repo is bound to compile well in Overleaf.

You can view the current version of the tranlation here:
